This repository hosts the source code for my [personal website](https://jarmos.netlify.app). It's statically generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) & the [PaperMod](https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/) theme. Hugo is a Static Site Generator(SSG) built with [Golang](https://golang.org). And the static files generated by Hugo are deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## :checkered_flag: Getting Started

If you've found my blog somehow on the Internet, got interested in what I say or perhaps you just need an excuse to participate in the open-source community, then your contributions are welcome here! But before that, here's a little bit about the website & what I'm trying to maintain;

- A simple, minimal-looking blog with no fluffy UI but mere knowledgeable content. The simpler interface, the better.
- Machine Learning is still a very academy-ey field of application. Recreating experiments & thoughts are had with the fast-moving advancements made every other day. Hence, it's important to provide references to every statement I provide towards the end of each article which is why you'll find a reference section at the end in certain articles.
- A non-intrusive blog without any on-the-face marketing lingoes.

### :running: The Easy & Quick Way To Get It Done

Perhaps you like the way my site is set up & would like to have one for yourself ASAP. If that's the case, this following section will help you.

#### :nut_and_bolt: Setup a Development Environment

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your copy of the repository locally using the command `git clone git@github.com:<INSERT_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE>/blog.git`.
3. Remove the files under the directory `content`. Note, the files are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). So, if you're active on GitHub writing your `.md` content will be a breeze.
4. Ensure you've Hugo installed & is available on PATH. If not, then follow the instructions available in [the official documentations](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).
5. Clone the PaperMod theme under the `./theme/` directory. Here's the [source code](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) repository.
6. Run the `hugo server` command on your preferred terminal & see if everything works as expected.

#### :dash: Preparing Your Site For Deployment

1. Write your articles inside the `content` directory & then check if its generated properly by running the `hugo server` command.
2. Push your changes to GitHub.
3. Create/login into an account on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
4. Link a remote repository by clicking on the "[New site from Git](https://app.netlify.com/start)" button.
5. That should help you set-up the forked repository on GitHub.
6. Once setup, clicking on "Deploy Site" button should trigger the build.
7. You can then check the site being deployed at this URL: `https://app.netlify.com/teams/<INSERT_NETLIFY_USERNAME_HERE>/sites`.
8. Once the site is deployed, Netlify assigns a domain automatically. It should look something on these lines: `https://<NETLIFY_GENERATED_ALPHANUMERIC_STRING>.netlify.app`.

<!-- TODO: Update section about using GitHub Actions instead -->
**NOTE:** Using GitHub Actions is preferred for building the static content. For more information refer to the section about building & deploying the static content with GitHub actions.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Built With

The site is built using Hugo to generate static content which are then delivered on Netlify's CDN. These are the primary 2 tools you will specifically need to build the website.

For more information on how to use these tools, refer to their respective documentations:

- [Netlify Docs](https://docs.netlify.com/)
- [Hugo o.80.0 Documentations](https://gohugo.io/documentations)

## :building_construction: Contributing
