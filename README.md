This repository houses the source code that my [personal blog](https://jarmos.netlify.com) is built with. I've used the [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) Static Site Generator(SSG) to build the static assets required by my website. The static content are available in `/content` so feel free to a pick at it.

## Development

If you plan on developing this project further, here's what you should do:

- Fork the repository & clone it locally by typing `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/pelican-blog.git`. Replace the `<your-username>` part with your GitHub username.
- `cd` into the `pelican-blog` directory by typing `cd pelican-blog`.
- It's highly recommended that you create a virtual environment by typing in `python -m venv venv`, where `venv` is the name of the virtual environment but the choice of the name can be anything.
- Install the dependencies by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Follow the official [Pelican Documentations](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/4.2.0/) to figure what to do next.
- Hack away & enjoy! Make your changes & then a make a PR. :)  

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to the repository but before you proceed ahead with it, it would be wonderful if you could adhere by the following guidelines:

- Open an Issue, if you want to add a feature or if you come across some anomaly.
- After you open an Issue, fork the repository & create a separate branch with the `feature-` prefixed with the branch name. That way the production branch stays clean & live without any breaking changes.
- Once you make a PR, please allow me a couple of hours to review the code changes but expect to receive a response in no more than 24 hours. Promise!
- Finally & perhaps once again, don't hesitate to open an Issue. I'll be happy to answer to any queries and/or questions.
