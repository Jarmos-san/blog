## Reporting a Vulnerability

Since the website is generated using a Static-site Generator, there's not much vulnerable surface area to attack. At most what could possibly go wrong is some accessibility issues from the viewer's end. If that's so please report it immediately.

You can follow the guidelines to report the problem(s) under [Contributing](../README.md#issues) section.
