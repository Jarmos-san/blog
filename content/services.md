I've been fortunate enough to be able to work with some amazing folks over the past couple of years. Most of them were business partners who co-founded some ventures with me or were small-scale business owners. And with their help, I garnered 4+ years of experience working on real business issues. And if you need an experienced helping hand as well, feel free to reach out to me!

Please find the details of my services & see if they fit your needs.

Following are the list of technologies I'm most familiar with:

**Note**: This tech stack is what I'm most confident with. In case you need help with something else, feel free to reach out to me. I might be able to help you out with something. :wink:

## Services

- **Software Development**: In need of a helping hand to setup a project or build you an application? Feel free to reach out to me.
- **Writing**: Need a Technical Writer to help you with a technical blog post or perhaps a book? Then look no further. Maybe, you're a company with a product looking to increase your user base? Then check out the [Sponsorship](../sponsorship/) page for collaboration opportunities.

## Rates & Payment Terms

I charge a flat rate of $75/hr for all services (except [Sponsorship](../sponsorship/) and/or collaboration deals). But, prices are subsidized for long-term projects (ones that could take 2+ months).

Payments are accepted over Direct Wire (preferred) and/or Transferwise. But, for whatever reasons, the payment transaction fails or can't be processed, PayPal works as well.

For any business queries, feel free to contact me. Here are my [contact details](../about/#contact-me).
