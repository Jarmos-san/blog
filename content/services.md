Over the past couple of years, I've been fortunate enough to be able to work with some amazing folks. Most of them were business partners who co-founded some ventures with me or were small-scale business owners. They helped me garner 4+ years of experience working on real business issues.

And are you a founder or a small-scale business owner as well? Perhaps my experience coupled with my skill set might benefit you in some way or the other. If so, read ahead & decide if you would like to hire me.

## Technology Stack

**Note**: The aforementioned tech stack is what I'm most confident with. So, in case you need help with something else, feel free to reach out to me. We can come up with a solution to the problem you're facing. :wink:

## Services, Rates, Payment Terms

I charge a flat rate of $75/hr but subsidize the prices on long-term projects (ones that could take 2+ months). Payments are accepted over Direct Wire (preferred) and/or Transferwise. But if for some reason the payment process can't be done on those platform then PayPal works as well.

For any business queries, please reach out to me over [email][Email] first with a detailed description of your needs. But, feel free to contact me elsewhere as well, here are my [contact details](../about/#contact-me).
