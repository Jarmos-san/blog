Do you find the content I share interesting? Would you like to collaborate on projects that could benefit both of us? Or perhaps you would just like to send a token of appreciation for all the content I share with you. If that's the case, this page details all the information to might need to do so.

## Review Post

Does your company have a brand new product? Or perhaps you already have a product & have just recently introduced new features to it. Then I can review it & share a detailed write-up for my audience to learn something from.

A standard review post has around 2000-3000 words with at least one cover image for SEO necessities. The standard review article would cost you $299.

Need something more than the standard deliverables? Then feel free to reach out to me with your requirements & we can work out a deal.

## Guest Post

If you enjoy reading my content & you think my contribution to your blog will of some benefit to you. Then I would absolutely love an invite for guest post on your blog! Do reach out to me for collaboration opportunities & we can come up with a deal.

## Send a Token of Appreciation

Sometimes you read an article or used one of my open-sourced software, found it useful & want to send out a token appreciation. Hence, for reasons like these, I created a [Buy me a coffee][Buy me a coffee] page. You can send over a minimum of $5 (_the average price of a book I enjoy reading_) or whatever amount you deem fit.

Do ensure, you leave a message with your name (_they're both optional on the platform though_). The message could be something as simple as the name of the book you want me to read. Or it could be a simple shoutout you want me to do on social media! You be the judge & compose a befitting message to send along with the token.

That said, a monetary token of appreciation is completely optional! If you find whatever I contribute useful, doesn't matter trivial, I would like to know. So, if $5 is too much for you, a customary thank you email or an anonymous ["Say Thank You"][Say Thank You] message will also do.

Every kind message & appreciation I receive motivates me to keep contributing for a good cause. :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:
