Hi there! My name is Somraj Saha & I'm an ML Engineer with 4+ years of contracting experience. Most of my clients are small-scale business owners or are startup founders. And, if you're one of them as well & in dire need of some Machine Learning services, perhaps you can reach out to me. You can find details to contact me towards the end.

### Languages & Tools I Use

- Programming languages like Python 3.
- Machine Learning (& Deep Learning) frameworks like Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow 2.x.
- Shell scripting in PowerShell 5.1.
- Preferred development envionments are Windows 10 & Ubuntu.
- Cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, Heroku.
- Backend frameworks like FastAPI for building RESTful services.

### My Services, Rates, Payment Terms, etc

I charge a flat rate of $65/hr but subsidize the prices on long-term projects (ones that could take 2+ months). And payments are accepted over Direct Wire (preferred), Transferwise & if they don't work for you then PayPal works as well.

### Contact Me

You can find me on various social media platforms, Twitter being the most active platform I use. While LinkedIn is used as a platform for client testimonials. That said, it's preferable you contact over email & send a brief description of your needs. So, here're the platforms you can find me on:

- [Email](mailto:somraj.mle@gmail.com)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jarmos)

I share content on my blog (and Twitter, on occassions), once in a while or maybe once a month. Hence, I maintain a newsletter where I share personalised content not more than twice a month. I respect your privacy & won't spam you with useless stuff, that's a promise. So, if you do want more content then what you could find on my blog, then make sure you subscribe to the newsletter.
