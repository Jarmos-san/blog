The beginning of 2020 was when I wanted to start my own personalized blog. Suffice to say, as I shopped around with available options, I figured each software (_or platform_) has something or the other to offer. While there's Wordpress, it requires a server backend & periodic security management. That's something I didn't want to get into, if I didn't have to. All I wanted was a way write content in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) & generate the static files (_think HTML + CSS + JavaScript files_) to be hosted on a CDN.

My initial attempt to do so was with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which didn't work out (_because I was still an inexperienced developer_). So, I jumped ship to [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) & [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which didn't work out either! _\*sighs\*_. But on a brighter note, I did come to terms (_for a while_) with a pretty good Static Site Generator (SSG) called [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/).

Alas, I couldn't stay faithful to Pelican either for long. I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate the static content of the site you're reading off of right now. And you could say I'm pretty satisfied with the outcome, for now.

I might appear fickle-minded to you but rest assured, the lessons I learnt might be useful for you if you want to start your own blog.

That said, without further ado, let's review some of the most popular SSGs or at least the ones I've used.

## Specific Aspects That Makes a SSG Worth It

- Easy installation process
- Legibility of the documentations
- Ease of use
- Availability of good-looking & modern themes
- Ease of customizing the available themes

## Jekyll & GitHub Pages

Jekyll is [advertised as a one-stop solution](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) for all your blogging needs. It's expected to work out-of-the-box without much configuration & complicated setup. And it's by far one of the most easiest to use among all the other SSGs mentioned in this article.

There're probably hundreds, if not thousands of themes both free & paid. You can find some of the resources to find themes listed of the [official Jekyll themes page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/). And you might find many more on GitHub, maintained by the community & made available free of costs.

While using Jekyll might be straightforward, I doubt you could say the same for installing it. Well, it's not "difficult to install" or something but the fact that you'll need to have a local Ruby runtime on your machine kinda triggers me.

Yeah, I'm being nitpicky here but if installing a runtime which you'll probably never use again outside of Jekyll doesn't bother you a bit, then go ahead with it.
