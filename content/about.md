Hi there! :wave: I'm Somraj Saha (_call me Jarmos, if my name is hard to pronounce_ :face_with_tongue:).

For a living, I work as an ML Engineer providing my 4+ years of experience to my clients. My past clients & business owners were amazing folks who I enjoyed working with every moment of it! :heart:

Besides work, I'm an amateur author writing books & other literary content. Most of them are technical and/or are related to software development in some sense. You can find some of my written work on my [blog](../blog/) where I share my thoughts & experiences as a programmer.

Other than that, there's also an occassional book I'm almost always working on the side. So, if you want some sneak peek into those works, follow me on Twitter ([@Jarmosan][Twitter]) and/or subscribe to the [newsletter][Newsletter] I maintain.

The rest of the time while I'm not working or writing, I contribute to open-source projects. You can check out my contributions on GitHub ([Jarmos-san][Github]).
